This is a content-based movie recommender system built using a dataset from Kaggle. It recommends movies based on the similarity of their features like title, overview, genres, etc., using vectorization techniques.

Features:
1. Recommends similar movies based on a selected title
2. Uses CountVectorizer or TF-IDF for text vectorization
3. Calculates similarity using cosine similarity
4. Easy to extend and modify

How It Works:
1. Movie metadata is preprocessed and combined into a single text column
2. Vectorization transforms this text into numerical features
3. Cosine similarity is calculated between movie vectors
4. Based on the similarity scores, top similar movies are recommended
